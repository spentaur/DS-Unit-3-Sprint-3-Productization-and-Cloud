## Module 1
- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    - I haven't ever used flask, but a lot of the concepts are very familiar
     to me so it came pretty easy.
- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    - It's always interesting to see how different languages approach
     different problems. The php framework I have been using for years
      accomplishes pretty much the same stuff, but in a way that I feel like
       is much easier.
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    - Getting used to sqlalchamey took a minute, it's much less human
     readable than the orm i am used to.

## Module 2
- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    - I was able to get all the tweets from a user and embed them and save
     them into the sqlite database.
 - What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    - I'm surprised by how bad of an api twitter has.
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    - I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why for trump's twitter
     account I would get back seemingly random amounts of tweets, sometimes
      1, sometimes 0, sometimes 93, sometimes 1800.

## Module 3
- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    - I was able to get a model trained and saved as a onnx file, which is
     something that I'd never heard of before. I've also never really done
      any NLP stuff so it was cool to see all the different ways of doing that.
 - What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    - Learning about onnx seems very interesting to me.
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    - Probably figuring out which model was best for NLP.
