# Module 1
- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    - I haven't ever used flask, but a lot of the concepts are very familiar
     to me so it came pretty easy.
- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    - It's always interesting to see how different languages approach
     different problems. The php framework I have been using for years
      accomplishes pretty much the same stuff, but in a way that I feel like
       is much easier.
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    - Getting used to sqlalchamey took a minute, it's much less human
     readable than the orm i am used to.
